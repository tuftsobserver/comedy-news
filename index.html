		<p id="p1">2016 has been a ride. Turning on a TV or reading political headlines reminds us of the uncertain state of the US. To cope, some suggest shutting down our computers and disengaging. Others preach conversation and dialogue.</p>
		
		<p>And for some of us, there&rsquo;s John Oliver.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Comedy news&rdquo; is a medium in which people discuss current events through humor (think Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee). For some Tufts students, this outlet &ldquo;is a coping mechanism for stressful and upsetting current events.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>To gauge how Tufts students interact with comedy news sources, the <span class="italic">Observer</span> conducted an anonymous online survey, to which 161 students responded over the past two weeks. Though the sample size is relatively small, the survey provides some interesting insights as to how comedy news is consumed among students. The survey found that over 90 percent of respondents watch comedy news in some capacity, whether that means actively following certain shows or viewing segments when they pop up on their newsfeeds. Furthermore, 46 percent of respondents said comedy was among their top news sources.</p>
		
		<p>Some students have turned to comedy news in order to manage the stress of this particular election. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never watched more comedy news than I have this election year,&rdquo; wrote one student.</p>

		<section class="ha-waypoint" data-animate-down="player2" data-animate-up="player1"></section>
		
		<p class="pullquote">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never watched more comedy news than I have this election year&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The most popular shows among Tufts students, according to the survey, are, in order, &ldquo;Last Week Tonight&rdquo; with John Oliver, &ldquo;The Colbert Report&rdquo; with Stephen Colbert (RIP), &ldquo;The Daily Show&rdquo; with Trevor Noah, and &ldquo;Saturday Night Live.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>It appears, then, that comedy news has a presence within the Tufts community. Part of this might be due to, as one survey respondent put it, the potential of comedy news to engage &ldquo;people who otherwise might not consume news media.&rdquo; Some respondents believe comedy news is more &ldquo;digestible.&rdquo; Another simply wrote, &ldquo;accessibility!!!!!!!!!&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Further, consuming comedy news appears an interesting manifestation of the attitudes of Tufts students&mdash;who skew liberal and interact personally with a variety of issues. Ninety-two percent of survey respondents agreed that comedy news is biased. But it&rsquo;s still popular.</p>
		
		<p>Does the Birkenstock-wearing Tufts student simply not care whether their news is slanted? Are millennials disregarding the value of objectivity? Does objectivity exist?</p>

		<p>Or, rather, is there appeal in the &ldquo;bias&rdquo; of comedy news? Fifty-three point five percent of respondents watch comedy news primarily for entertainment. It comes without the bore of regular news, some think. One respondent wrote, &ldquo;Standard, commonly viewed news sources such as CNN rarely have anything to say about anything.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>For the half of respondents who do use comedy as news source, some expressed that they appreciate the bias. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s primarily a tool of persuasion, not education,&rdquo; wrote one respondent. &ldquo;I consider my favorite shows to be a more entertaining version of an op-ed.&rdquo; Perhaps, watching comedy news allows some Tufts students to shore-up their views or arguments.</p>
		
		<p>Comedy news, wrote another respondent, &ldquo;can point out the absurdity of our world.&rdquo; Maybe in a year like 2016, news that matches our confusion and hysteria resonates more deeply with us.</p>

		<section class="ha-waypoint" data-animate-down="player3" data-animate-up="player2"></section>

		<p>Another respondent posited that comedy news is actually more honest than other sources: &ldquo;By putting their biases at the front rather than trying to hide them, they can appear more trustworthy.&rdquo; In recognizing that comedian-reporters like Oliver and Bee&mdash;and even Colbert, who played a satirically conservative character&mdash;are not hiding their views, some feel more able to interact with them.</p>

		<p>Some Tufts students believe this transparency is really important. One wrote, &ldquo;Shows like Last Week Tonight also do expos&eacute;s that can increase awareness of less well known or less trendy issues.&rdquo; Respondents and students (who often share clips on Facebook to support their arguments) seem to appreciate the blunt nature with which these shows approach their subjects.</p>
		
		<p>Another student, however, thinks that comedy news creates a dichotomy of their views vs. the &ldquo;conservatives.&rdquo; They wrote that comedy news &ldquo;brainwashes neoliberals into believing there is a large difference in the character of the two political parties, instead, both parties are guilty of corruption, warcrimes, and economic terrorism.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>Regardless, then, of where they fall on the (left side of the) political spectrum, Tufts students seem to be engaging continuously and deeply with comedy news. Perhaps these shows provide stability. As this wild election draws to a close, we can count on comics on the news to, as one respondent put it, &ldquo;Call it like it is.&rdquo;</p>
